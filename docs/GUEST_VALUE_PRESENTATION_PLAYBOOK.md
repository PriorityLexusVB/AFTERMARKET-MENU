# Guest Value Presentation Playbook

## Goal
Help guests quickly understand *why* protection matters (beyond factory coverage), then guide them to a confident "yes" by matching a tier to their priorities.

## The 3 value pillars (say this early)
1. **Keep it looking new**: protect paint, glass, and interior from real-world driving.
2. **Avoid surprise costs**: reduce out-of-pocket repairs for common damage categories.
3. **Protect future value**: preserve trade-in / resale confidence by preventing visible wear.

## Quick setup (10 seconds)
- Enter the guest name + vehicle in the customer dialog (top-right).
- Tell the guest: "This is a 2-minute overview. Then we’ll review options tailored to your vehicle."

## Recommended flow (best for conversion)
### 1) Set the frame (RS1)
- "This is a quick overview of the types of damage owners actually deal with."
- "We’ll focus on the gap between factory warranty and real-world driving."

### 2) Confirm what factory coverage is (RS2)
- "Lexus is world-class mechanically. Factory coverage is about defects and mechanical reliability."
- "Most guests don’t have mechanical problems; the daily issues are usually appearance, exposure, and wear."

### 3) Reinforce dealership lifetime commitment (RS3)
- "You’re covered for the mechanical side of ownership long-term."
- Transition: "Now let’s protect the parts you *see and touch* every day."

### 4) Name the real gap (RS4)
- "Most damage isn’t mechanical: chips, stains, etching, and wear reduce the vehicle’s look and its equity."
- Ask a soft question: "Do you park outside, commute highways, or have kids/pets?"

### 5) Make it local + believable (RS5)
- "Here, coastal air + road conditions accelerate wear. This is why the protection is built for this region."

### 6) Product slides (RS6–RS11)
Keep these fast. Don’t over-explain chemistry—translate to outcomes.
- RS6: **RustGuard** = long-term structure + corrosion defense.
- RS7: **ToughGuard** = chemical + climate barrier for exterior exposure.
- RS8: **InteriorGuard** = stain/spill protection and cabin preservation.
- RS9: **Diamond Shield** = windshield impact protection.
- RS10: **Highway Hazards: Suntek Film** = kinetic impact defense for daily driving.
- RS11: **Evernew** = digital reconditioning + appearance preservation.

## Closing script (RS12)
- "Based on what you told me, we’ll keep this simple: Gold covers the biggest risks, Platinum is the most popular for daily driving, and Elite is the max protection for long-term value."
- "Want to see the differences side-by-side, or should we start with the one that best matches your priorities?"

## Objection handling (short, non-defensive)
- **"Isn’t this covered by warranty?"**
  - "Factory warranty is for defects. Most of this is daily driving and environmental damage."
- **"I have insurance."**
  - "Insurance is great for big events; these packages focus on the common, recurring stuff that affects how the car looks and feels."
- **"I’ll be careful."**
  - "Totally. The point is: you can’t control other drivers, the road, or the weather."
- **"I might trade it soon."**
  - "That’s exactly when appearance and visible wear matter most for trade-in confidence."
