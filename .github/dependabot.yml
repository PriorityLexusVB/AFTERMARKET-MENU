# Dependabot configuration for Priority Lexus Aftermarket Menu
# Automatically checks for dependency updates with intelligent grouping
#
# Features:
# - Daily checks for npm dependencies at repository root
# - Named groups for related packages to minimize PR noise
# - Auto rebase strategy to keep branches up-to-date
# - Auto-merge for patch/minor updates (when required checks pass)
# - Major updates remain open for review (with automation workflow support)
