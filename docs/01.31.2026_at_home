PR #152 (Pick2 decoupling + guardrails + runbook) merged to main.
Post‑merge validation on main completed earlier: npm ci, npm run build, npm run test:run, npm run test:e2e all passed.
Current blocker: Firebase MCP not available to this session. npm run firebase:mcp failed due to Firebase CLI auth earlier; after reauth, MCP still not exposed to this session.
Pick2 Firestore updates (config + ala_carte_options) were not performed yet.
Last request to enable Pick2 for 9 items with sort order and shortValue/highlights remains pending, as does re‑query + targeted E2E.
